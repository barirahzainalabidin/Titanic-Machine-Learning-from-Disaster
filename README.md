# Machine Learning Canvas 

# 1. Background:

Goal: The primary objective is to predict whether passengers survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Customer Pain Point: Predicting survival is critical to developing safety protocols for similar situations in the future, and historical data provides insights that can help in such predictions.

# 2. Value Proposition:

For Stakeholders: This model helps identify key factors that contributed to passenger survival, which could inform safety measures or guide similar predictive tasks in real-world settings.

For the Competition: Youâ€™ll create a robust predictive model that can be ranked against others in the Kaggle competition.

# 3. Objectives:
   
Primary Objective: Build a model to predict survival based on the available passenger data.

Sub-Objectives:

Data cleaning and preparation.

Feature engineering to improve model performance.

Select the best model and fine-tune it for optimal predictions.
